Hi! We at Ecwid by Lightspeed are highly interested in hiring developers in Tbilisi and Yerevan.

We are developing the coolest SaaS platform for doing business online. This probably doesn't tell you anything as an engineer, 
so I'll try to go in through an analogy. If you want a platform for development - you take GitHub. If it's for online commerce - Ecwid.
As an engineer you'll need to develop new features and fix bugs, or simply write code. 
You don't need to do design, you don't need to do layout, you don't need to come up with texts, 
you don't need to communicate with some mythical "customers". We have other people in our team for this purpose and they love layout, design and texts.

We give MacBook Pro and RSU (restricted stock units of the company). Our processes include friendly code review, CI, 
auto-tests, and dozens of releases per day. Our infrastructure has 100+ microservices, hundreds of terabytes of traffic, 
Kotlin, Java, TypeScript, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Redis, SOLR, ClickHouse, and probably something else I can't remember off the top of my head.

Choose any test task, do it as you see fit and send the result to join-ecom@lightspeedhq.com.
