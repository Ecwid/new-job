You have a simple text file with IPv4 addresses. One line is one address, line by line:

```
145.67.23.4
8.34.5.23
89.54.3.124
89.54.3.124
3.45.71.5
...
```

The file is unlimited in size and can occupy tens and hundreds of gigabytes.

You should calculate the number of __unique addresses__ in this file using as little memory and time as possible. 
There is a "naive" algorithm for solving this problem (read line by line, put lines into HashSet). 
It's better if your implementation is more complicated and faster than this naive algorithm.

Some details:
- For any questions, feel free to write to join-ecom@lightspeedhq.com
- You should write in GO lang.
- The completed assignment should be posted on GitHub

Before submitting an assignment, it will be nice to check how it handles this [file](https://ecwid-vgv-storage.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ip_addresses.zip). Attention - the file weighs about 20Gb, and unzips to about 120Gb.
